# 🎉 DDCET Result Scraper (MERN Edition) 🎉  
Say goodbye to captchas, and hello to all the data at once!

Welcome to the MERN-powered web scraper that laughs in the face of captchas and fetches all the data from the **ACPC DDCET result website**. Forget about solving simple math problems — we’re taking a direct route to the backend, because, well... someone left the door unlocked. 😎  
This scraper works on any result service hosted under the magical [ACPC website](https://acpc.gujarat.gov.in/). Because who doesn’t love a little backend exploration, am I right?

## 🧙‍♂️ The Magic of CAPTCHA Bypass:
Here’s where it gets funny: the captcha validation happens *entirely* on the frontend. Yes, you read that right. All we had to do was send requests directly to the backend, skipping the captcha altogether. It’s like avoiding the bouncer and sneaking in through the side door.

## ⚠️ Legal Disclaimer:
**Please Note:** This scraper is built for *educational purposes* and should be used responsibly. Web scraping can sometimes violate terms of service, so make sure you aren't breaking any rules. If ACPC realizes their captcha vulnerability and moves validation to the backend, well… you might have to actually solve that math problem. 😅

## 💬 Closing Thoughts:
As long as ACPC keeps trusting its frontend with security, this scraper will happily do the dirty work for you. So sit back, relax, and let the scraper do what it does best — bypass captchas and fetch results like a boss.

## 🌍 .env Example:
Make sure to add your own environment variables in a `.env` file in the backend of your project.

```bash
MONGO_URL=""
CLIENT_URL=""
CLIENT_URL2=""
```
